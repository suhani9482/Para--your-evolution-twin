## Technical Implementation Details

### API Integration Code
The application connects to Google's Gemini API using fetch requests with appropriate headers and error handling:

```javascript
async function getGeminiResponse(userMessage, emotion = "neutral") {
    try {
        // Create context for the API with emotion information from dataset
        let emotionInfo = "...";
        
        // Create full context
        let context = `You are PARA Evolution Twin, an empathetic AI coach...`;
        
        const response = await fetch(`https://generativelanguage.googleapis.com/v1beta/models/gemini-pro:generateContent?key=${API_KEY}`, {
            method: 'POST',
            headers: {
                'Content-Type': 'application/json',
            },
            body: JSON.stringify({
                contents: [
                    {
                        parts: [
                            {
                                text: `${context}\n\nUser message: "${userMessage}"\n\nPlease provide a supportive, empathetic response:`
                            }
                        ]
                    }
                ],
                generationConfig: {
                    temperature: 0.7,
                    maxOutputTokens: 150,
                }
            })
        });
        
        // Process response...
    } catch (error) {
        // Error handling...
    }
}
```

### Emotion Detection Algorithm
The application detects emotions using pattern matching against an extensive dataset:

```javascript
function detectEmotionEnhanced(message) {
    message = message.toLowerCase();
    
    // First try to use the dataset for detection
    if (emotionDataset && emotionDataset.core_emotions && emotionDataset.core_emotions.length > 0) {
        let highestMatchCount = 0;
        let detectedEmotion = "neutral";
        
        for (const emotionData of emotionDataset.core_emotions) {
            let matchCount = 0;
            
            // Check triggers
            if (emotionData.triggers) {
                for (const trigger of emotionData.triggers) {
                    if (message.includes(trigger.toLowerCase())) {
                        matchCount += 2; // Weight triggers higher
                    }
                }
            }
            
            // Check verbal expressions
            if (emotionData.expressions && emotionData.expressions.verbal) {
                for (const expression of emotionData.expressions.verbal) {
                    if (message.includes(expression.toLowerCase())) {
                        matchCount += 3; // Weight expressions highest
                    }
                }
            }
            
            if (matchCount > highestMatchCount) {
                highestMatchCount = matchCount;
                detectedEmotion = emotionData.emotion.toLowerCase();
            }
        }
        
        if (highestMatchCount > 0) {
            return detectedEmotion;
        }
    }
    
    // Fall back to original emotion detection if no match found
    return detectEmotion(message);
}
```
